# checkout (uploaded to a scratch copy of the repository first). It has
# a native binary `gen` that writes dist/pwa/ (bridge.js and app.wasm,
# with pwa) and a wasm binary `app` that drives dom; check.mjs runs the
# app in jsdom with the generated bridge.js and prints the resulting
# HTML, which must match the package's `expected` file exactly.
#
# usage: tests/dynamic/run.sh <repository-dir>
